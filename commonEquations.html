		This program will utilize Java Swing and AWT components to then allow the 
		user to put in values for formulas and use threads to read JSON files online 
		for some derivatives. Some features will be the ability to utilize a large amount
		of equations and solve most derivatives. I would have liked to implement a fully 
		capable derivative solver and an integral solver. This program will use Java and 
		read from JSON files that will be on Microsoft Azure. I will be showing the WindowListener
		and threads reading JSON files. I am not sure what I will be implementing past our class at
		the moment.
